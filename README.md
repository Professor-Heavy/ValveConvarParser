# Valve Convar Parser
A console application capable of lookingthrough a directory of source code from Valve Corporation's source files, and producing them in a variety of formats.

## Usage

```Usage: "ConvarParser.exe [Input Path] [Output Path] [Output Format (sql/txt)]```

The SQL output format will produce a .txt file anyway.

## Planned Features
1. SQL Export
2. Filter arguments for .txt exports
3. Better code organization for personal uses

Yes, the description is currently incorrect, but it IS still a planned feature.
